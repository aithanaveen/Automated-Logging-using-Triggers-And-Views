# Automated Logging using Triggers And Views
This project implements automated audit logging using MySQL triggers and views. Triggers record every INSERT and UPDATE operation into an audit table, while a view generates daily activity reports. It ensures data tracking, transparency, and compliance, similar to real-time logging systems used in enterprise databases.
